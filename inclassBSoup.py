# No ouptput

#YOUR CODE 2

# No output

#YOUR CODE 3
# Write/plan code to print the URL to the XKCD comic, using BSoup and this file.

#YOUR CODE 4
# Write code to grab all the links (URLs) in that html page, but nothing else.

#YOUR CODE 7
# - Write/plan code to grab the alt text associated with the image of the XKCD comic.

# OUTPUT -

#YOUR CODE 7
# Write  code to assign the BeautifulSoup object holding the div that contains the image to a variable `image_div_obj`
#Ouput: print image_div_obj

#YOUR CODE 7
# - Write/plan code to add these three strings to a list, using just BSoup and the html doc availableâ€¦
#   > An image from the comic XKCD below.
#   > Find more similar stuff at the comic web site.

# first, get the thing that contains them all, the span! store in variable names span_container
# print span_conainer


#second, get ll of the paragraphs in the span_container and store in a variable called paragraph_tags
# print paragraph_tags
